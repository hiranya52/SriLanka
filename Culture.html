            <font face="Veranda" size="5">The culture of Sri Lanka mixes modern elements with traditional aspects and is
                known for its regional diversity.<br>
                Sri Lankan culture has long been influenced by the heritage of Theravada Buddhism and the religion's
                legacy is
                particularly strong in Sri Lanka below the northern region.<br> South Indian cultural influences are
                especially
                pronounced in the northernmost reaches of the country. <br>The history of colonial occupation has also
                left a mark
                on Sri Lanka's identity, with Portuguese, Dutch, and British elements having intermingled with various
                traditional facets of Sri Lankan culture.<br>Culturally, Sri Lanka possesses strong links to both India
                and
                Southeast Asia.[1] For over 5000 years, India and Sri Lanka have nurtured a legacy of historical,
                cultural,
                religious, spiritual, and linguistic connections.</font>

                            and the visual arts. Sri Lankan culture is <br>internationally associated with cricket, a
                            distinct cuisine,<br>
                            an indigenous holistic medicine practice, religious iconography such as the Buddhist

                            such as tea, cinnamon, and gemstones, <br>as well as a robust tourism industry. Sri Lanka
                            has longstanding
                            ties with the Indian subcontinent that can be traced back to prehistory.Sri Lanka's
                            population is

                    <p><font face="Arial" size="4">Sri Lanka was first inhabited by Homo sapiens who traversed the
                            Indian Ocean about 125,000 years ago.Sri Lanka has a documented history of over 3,000
                            years, mainly due to ancient historic scriptures like Mahawamsa, and with the first stone
                            objects dating back to 500,000 BCE. Several centuries of intermittent foreign influence
                            has transformed Sri Lankan culture to its present form. Nevertheless, the ancient traditions
                            and festivals are still celebrated on the island, together with other minorities that make
                            up the Sri Lankan identity.<br><br>One very important aspect that differentiates Sri Lankan history is its view on women. Women
                            and men in Sri Lanka have been viewed equal for thousands of years from ruling the country
                            to how they dress. Both men and women had the chance to rule the land, which is true even in
                            the modern day. The world's first female prime minister, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, was from Sri
                            Lanka.</font></p>
